# shldn 
## Sheldon Cooper ALWAYS points out what (he thinks) is wrong with people and their work.

## Motivation

- Python 2 won't be supported past 2020 [:clock830:](https://pythonclock.org/)
- Division in Python 3 always returns a `float`; whereas division in Python 2 can return an `int`

## Objective
Sheldon is a console-application to help anyone find all the divisions in Python source code in order to facilitate transitioning Python 2 code to Python 3. 

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Install


## Usage

To run Sheldon, run the `leonard.py` script with Python 3. The package contains a
`Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` for the virtualenv of Sheldon.
